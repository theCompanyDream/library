# Library

The Book Library App is a simple, intuitive React application for managing a collection of books. It allows users to add new books to the library, view a list of all added books, and edit details of existing books. This application is built using Create React App and provides a straightforward interface for basic CRUD operations.

## Installing

1. git clone git@github.com:theCompanyDream/library.git
2. cd library
3. yarn
4. yarn start

## Features

- Add Book: Users can add new books to the library with details like title, author, and ISBN.
- View Books: Users can view a list of all added books.
- Edit Book: Users can edit the details of existing books.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Create React App - Used to bootstrap the development
React - The web framework used

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
